--Introduction--


In the US, breast cancer makes up one-third of all new cancer cases in women every year  
(American Cancer Society, 2025). When breast cancer is caught early, the 5-year relative survival rate in the US is 99% (National Breast Cancer, 2025). The survival rate remains over 90% for most countries when caught early, but drops to only 30% if caught after metastasis, when the cancer spreads to other parts of the body (Hofeld and Schaffner, 2024). The best way to detect breast cancer is through a mammogram (Cancer Research UK, 2025).  Unfortunately, 12.5% of mammogram images are misclassified during screening, partly due to human error (American Cancer Society, 2022). However, human error can be avoided or reduced by training an AI model to classify mammogram images. In the UK alone, there are roughly 32 breast cancer deaths a day (Cancer Research UK, 2019). Every malignant tumor misclassified as a benign tumor is a person who may not receive the care they need in time. Our goal is to develop a model that accurately classifies breast masses as benign or malignant based on mammogram images.
